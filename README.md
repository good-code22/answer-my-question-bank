# answer-my-question-bank
This copy and pastes the question from your list of questions (preprocessed by adding # at the end of each question) into chatgpt. There are three buttons, 
green button => paste the next question
red button => paste the previous question (i dont know why anyone would use this)
note button => for creating a new window where you can write something like a note

I had to use custom tkinter (tkinter does not have a progress bar?)
There are 2 images for buttons and a buch of sound files that i downloaded from pixaby for the clicking and typing sound.
You also need a txt file that would store your question bank and you have to add # at end of every question as a seperator.
